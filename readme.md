## üåê Background <a name="background"></a> ##
Westwood is a critical neighborhood in Los Angeles for UCLA students, business owners, and commuters. However, transportation organizations such as Streets for All have highlighted how the current infrastructure neglects the safety of those who do not own cars and offers them few comfortable alternatives. Even the supposedly walkable, student-friendly Westwood Village is suffering from the current car-optimized setup with a 32% business vacancy rate. Even worse, 4 of its main streets are all on the City of LA‚Äôs High Injury Network. To help shift the weight off of car dependency, UCLA Transportation has offered subsidized public transit passes for services such as Metro and the Big Blue Bus in the Westwood area. However, there has not been a substantial increase in students and employees using public transit in 2021. It is evident that car-alternative incentives do not change the core issue - the current infrastructure has made any other form of transportation besides driving inconvenient, uncomfortable, and dangerous.

## üìå Objectives <a name="objectives"></a> ##
The objective project is to advocate for non-motorized transportation by partnering with the Westwood Connected initiative to provide insight into travel experiences into Westwood Village. This includes information such as departure locations and thoughts about not driving into Westwood. We also seek to empower the Westwood community by offering a platform to talk about their transportation concerns with the current infrastructure in a way that humanizes and highlights their unique perspectives and desires. We plan to achieve this goal by conducting a community outreach survey with Westwood community members and integrating their stories in an interactive map showcasing their geographic diversity and interconnectedness.

## üôå Empowered Community <a name="community"></a> ##
The communities we hope to empower through our project include those who live in Westwood, those who work in Westwood, and those who drive into Westwood. These consist of UCLA students, business owners, business employees, business patrons, and campus visitors to name a few. We also hope to empower the often-overlooked voices in the car-dependent infrastructure discussion, specifically students and those who take alternative forms of transportation. This is especially important since most of these groups don‚Äôt own a car, which increases their risk of being victims of car-related accidents and discomfort. To reach out to UCLA students and frequent visitors, we will be distributing our online survey through popular messaging platforms such as GroupMe and Discord. For business owners and employees, we will visit the businesses in-person to distribute after receiving their contact information.

## üíª Technology Used <a name="technology"></a> ##
Westwood Reimagined was created using HTML as the base for the website, Javascript for interactivity and data integration, as well as CSS for styling. Leaflet, a Javascript library, was used to create the interactive map. Google Forms was used to create our survey, while Google Sheets was used to collect and organize the survey data. Custom geocode was then added to Google Sheets App Script to populate location data. Papa Parse, a CSV Parser for Javascript was used to fetch our Google Sheets data and integrate it into our site. Finally, we used the [v2-sidebar](https://github.com/Turbo87/sidebar-v2/tree/master) plugin to display Westwood community members' transportation stories.

## Future Repurposing <a name="future"></a> ##

Others could utilize this technology to create interactive maps, collect survey data, and create a site that marries the two like we did.
