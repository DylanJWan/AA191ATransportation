# Public Transportation

### Car-centric ideologies pervade much of American transportation sentiment which discourages development, improvement, and innovation in the fields of public transportation. Buses, trains, and subways have thus been stimatized as "poor wagons" that provide transportation to poor, homeless, and unstable members of society while sapping money from tax payers. We wish to highlight trouble spots where there is less reliable, frequent, and timely service for public transportation in order to give more power to those who cannot afford a car, those who choose not to own a car, and those who simply wish to explore Los Angeles without the stress of a car. We may face technical issues in accessing and manipulating data from public transportation agencies in a responsive and interactive format. There is also the issue of providing this information to people without access to the Internet who may constitute a decent population of those who use public transit.
