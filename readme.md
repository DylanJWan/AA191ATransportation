# Westwood Reminagined: Mapping for Human-centric Infrastructure

Westwood Reimagined was created using HTML as the base for the website, Javascript for interactivity and data integration, as well as CSS for styling. Leaflet, a Javascript library, was used to create the interactive map. Google Forms was used to create our survey, while Google Sheets was used to collect and organize the survey data. Custom geocode was then added to Google Sheets App Script to populate location data. Finally, Papa Parse, a CSV Parser for Javascript, was used to fetch our Google Sheets data and integrate it into our site. Others could utilize this technology to create websites with an interactive map populated with constantly updated survey data.
